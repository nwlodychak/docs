- `frozenset()` is immutable and hashable.
- functions can modify objects outside of their scope.
- e.g frozen set has no attribute `.pop` while the list will be modified.

```python
def func(sequence):
    x = sequence.pop(0)
    print(f'Popped: {x}')

set_data = frozenset(_ for _ in range(10)
list_data = [_ for _ in range(10)]
```

- Local encodings can be different for example in the short script following on MacOS

```python
expression = 'locale.getpreferredencoding()'

value = eval(expression)
print(f'{expression:>30} -> {value!r}')
```

```python
locale.getpreferredencoding() -> 'UTF-8'
```

versus the following output on Windows

```python
locale.getpreferredencoding() -> 'cp1252'
```

Can get around this by surrounding the unicode literal in `\\N{}` - this is also why it is important to set encoding when opening a file `with open(file, encoding='utf-8')`

```python
test_chars = [
    '\\N{CIRCLED NUMBER FORTY TWO}',  # not in cp437 or in cp1252
]

for char in test_chars:
    print(f'Trying to output {name(char)}:')
    print(char)
```

Also two strings can look identical but be different code points

```python
from unicodedata import normalize

s1 = 'caf√©'
s2 = 'cafe\\N{COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT}'

len(s1), len(s2)
(4, 5)
s1 == s2
False

# using the normalize function
len(normalize('NFC', s1)), len(normalize('NFC', s2))
(4, 4)
normalize('NFC', s1) == normalize('NFC', s2)
True
```
